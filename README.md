# S.A.M.
A chat bot created in a group project in CSC 340: Artificial Intelligence
This project is a basic conversational chat bot. This chat bot takes your answers to a series of small questions and will answer those
questions in different ways. Using decision trees, S.A.M. won't always answer the same way. For this project, I used Weka to help generate
the these decision trees based on .csv files which are converted into .arrf file to help with S.A.M.'s response.
